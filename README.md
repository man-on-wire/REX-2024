About: Analyzing the impact of school proximity on graduation rates for Indigenous Nations using geospatial and statistical modeling in R.

Intro
Educational attainment among Indigenous communities is a critical topic in Canada, as it often lags behind the national average due to systemic barriers. Existing literature cites contributing factors such as geographical isolation, school quality, and lingering socio-economic impacts from a legacy of colonialism. These studies provide foundational insights but there exists a gap at a more fundamental level of access to education - how physically accessible the high schools are.
Literature and Research Gap

Gordon et al. (2014) and Layton (2021) speak to how transition rates from high school to post-secondary within five years for Indigenous learners lag behind non-Indigenous learners and how high-school completion rates also lag. Much of the existing literature explaining this focuses on demographic-based correlations [1, 2], the need for traditional and cultural curricula [3], and existing socioeconomic conditions that reduce education accessibility and incentive to complete a diploma [4]. 

While there is some research isolating remoteness as a factor, it focuses on remoteness of the reservations, rather than the high schools themselves. However, the results from these findings [5] show that indigenous individuals living off-reserve are more likely to complete high school than those living on reserves and that remoteness has a significant impact on secondary educational attainment. This means a potential for similar findings at a more localized level. 

Besides filling a variable gap in existing research, examining high school proximity to indigenous communities presents more immediate opportunities for policy making - expanding public transit, building closer schools funded by Indigenous Services Canada, etc. - whereas broader, structural barriers of education are more difficult to resolve.
